00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:08,120
<i>People always ask me
if I know Tyler Durden.</i>

3
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,040
Three minutes.

4
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,580
This is it. Ground zero.

5
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,250
Want to say a few words for the occasion?

6
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,840
<i>With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.</i>

7
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,590
I can't think of anything.

8
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,850
<i>For a second, I forget about
Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>

9
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,060
<i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>

10
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,100
It's getting exciting now.

11
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,310
<i>That old saying,
how you always hurt the one you love,</i>

12
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
<i>well, it works both ways.</i>

13
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,990
<i>We have front-row seats
for this theater of mass destruction.</i>

14
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,320
<i>The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem</i>

15
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:46,990
<i>wrapped the foundation columns
of a dozen buildings with blasting gelatin.</i>

16
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,710
<i>In two minutes,
primary charges will blow base charges</i>

17
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,250
<i>and a few blocks will be reduced
to smoldering rubble.</i>

18
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,380
<i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>

19
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,380
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

20
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:06,010
<i>Suddenly I realize that all of this -
the gun, the bombs, the revolution -</i>

21
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,560
<i>has got something to do
with a girI named Marla Singer.</i>

22
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,770
<i>Bob. Bob had bitch tits.</i>

23
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,530
<i>This was a support group
for men with testicular cancer.</i>

24
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,950
<i>The big moosie slobbering all over me,
that was Bob.</i>

25
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,990
We're still men.

26
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,990
Yes, we're men.

27
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,290
Men is what we are.

28
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,370
<i>Bob had had his testicles removed.
Then hormone therapy.</i>

29
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,040
<i>He developed bitch tits
'cause his testosterone was too high</i>

30
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,210
<i>and his body upped the estrogen.</i>

31
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,590
<i>- That was where I fit.
- They'll have to drain my pecs again.</i>

32
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,550
<i>Between those huge, sweating tits</i>

33
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,060
<i>that hung enormous,
the way you'd think of God's as big.</i>

34
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,310
OK, you cry now.

35
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,390
<i>No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</i>

36
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,650
<i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>

37
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,940
<i>I couldn't sleep...</i>

38
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,820
<i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>

39
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,660
<i>Everything's far away.</i>

40
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,080
<i>Everything's a copy of a copy</i>

41
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,580
<i>of a copy.</i>

42
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,080
<i>When deep-space exploration ramps up,</i>

43
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,170
<i>it'll be the corporations
that name everything.</i>

44
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,300
<i>The IBM Stellar Sphere.</i>

45
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,670
<i>The Microsoft Galaxy.</i>

46
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,050
<i>The Planet Starbucks.</i>

47
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,430
I need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags.

48
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,100
<i>It must have been Tuesday.
He had on his cornflower-blue tie.</i>

49
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,810
You want me to deprioritize my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?

50
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,440
Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons.
Call me if there's any snags.

51
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,280
<i>He was full of pep.
Must have had his grande latte enema.</i>

52
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,410
<i>Like so many others, I had become
a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct.</i>

53
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,290
<i>- I'd like to order Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.
- Please hold.</i>

54
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,130
<i>If I saw something clever,
like a coffee table</i>

55
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,210
<i>in the shape of a yin-yang, I had to have it.</i>

56
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,680
<i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>

57
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,340
<i>The Hovetrekke home exerbike.</i>

58
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,140
<i>Or the Ohamshab sofa
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>

59
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,060
<i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally friendly unbleached paper.</i>

60
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,480
<i>I'd flip through catalogs and wonder:</i>

61
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,780
<i>What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?</i>

62
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:29,450
<i>I had it all. Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>

63
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,660
<i>proof that they were
crafted by the honest,</i>

64
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,330
<i>hard-working, indigenous peoples of...</i>

65
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,790
<i>- Please hold.
- ... wherever.</i>

66
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,380
<i>We used to read pornography.</i>

67
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,380
<i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>

68
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,760
- No. You can't die of insomnia.
- What about narcolepsy?

69
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,430
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.
I have no idea how I got there.

70
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,520
- You need to lighten up.
- Can you please just give me something?

71
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,640
<i>Red and blue Tuinals,
lipstick- red Seconals...</i>

72
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,520
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.

73
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,570
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.

74
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,740
- Hey, come on. I'm in pain.
- You wanna see pain?

75
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,620
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.
See the guys with testicular cancer.

76
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,830
That's pain.

77
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,230
I always wanted three kids.
Two boys and a girl.

78
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,560
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

79
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,570
We never could agree on anything.

80
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,150
Well, she had her first child last week.

81
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,320
A girl.

82
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,330
With her... with her new husband.

83
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,580
And thank God. You know?

84
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,000
I- I'm glad for her.

85
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,800
Because she deserves it.

86
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,680
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

87
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,430
Thank you, Thomas.

88
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,230
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.

89
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,560
And that gives me strength.

90
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,770
We give each other strength.

91
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,610
It's time for the one-on-ones.

92
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,360
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example
and really open ourselves up.

93
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,240
Could you find a partner?

94
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,410
<i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>

95
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,670
<i>His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.</i>

96
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,470
<i>Knees together.
Those awkward little steps.</i>

97
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,100
- My name is Bob.
- Bob?

98
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,350
<i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>

99
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,810
<i>You know that chest expansion
program on late-night TV?</i>

100
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,270
<i>That was his idea.</i>

101
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,900
I was a juicer.

102
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,780
You know -using steroids.

103
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,780
Diabonal and... Wisterol.

104
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,830
Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Christ's sakes.

105
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,580
And now I'm bankrupt, I'm divorced,

106
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:33,510
my two grown kids
won't even return my phone calls.

107
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:39,010
<i>Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>

108
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:43,680
Go ahead... Cornelius.

109
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,190
You can cry.

110
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,870
<i>And then... something happened.
I let go.</i>

111
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,710
That's really good.

112
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,750
<i>Lost in oblivion.</i>

113
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,460
<i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>

114
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,470
<i>I found freedom.</i>

115
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,470
<i>Losing all hope was freedom.</i>

116
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,850
It's OK.

117
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,440
<i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>

118
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,150
<i>I became addicted.</i>

119
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,500
<i>If I didn't say anything,
people always assumed the worst.</i>

120
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,800
<i>They cried harder...</i>

121
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,130
<i>then I cried harder.</i>

122
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,060
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...

123
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,270
<i>I wasn't really dying.</i>

124
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:17,530
<i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>

125
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,870
<i>I was the warm little center
that the life of this world crowded around.</i>

126
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,700
Imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.

127
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,710
It moves over your body, healing you.

128
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,290
Now keep this going.
Remember to breathe.

129
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,880
And step forward
through the back door of the room.

130
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,590
Where does it lead?

131
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,680
To your cave.

132
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,600
Step forward into your cave.

133
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,020
That's right.

134
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,690
<i>You're going deeper into your cave,</i>

135
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:58,070
<i>and you're going to find
your power animal.</i>

136
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,660
Slide.

137
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,460
<i>Every evening I died.</i>

138
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,250
<i>And every evening I was born again.</i>

139
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,300
<i>Resurrected.</i>

140
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:27,180
<i>Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.</i>

141
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,730
<i>Being there, pressed against his tits,
ready to cry.</i>

142
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,270
<i>This was my vacation.</i>

143
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,780
<i>And she... ruined everything.</i>

144
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,740
This is cancer, right?

145
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,290
<i>This chick, Marla Singer,
did not have testicular cancer.</i>

146
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,420
<i>She was a liar.</i>

147
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,960
<i>She had no diseases at all.</i>

148
00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:00,090
<i>I had seen her at Free And Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>

149
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,300
<i>Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>

150
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,010
<i>And again at Seize The Day,
my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>

151
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,140
<i>Marla, the big tourist.</i>

152
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,150
<i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>

153
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,900
<i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>

154
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,610
<i>I couldn't cry.
So once again, I couldn't sleep.</i>

155
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,500
<i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>

156
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,960
<i>after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,</i>

157
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,930
<i>I'll grab that bitch Marla Singer
and scream:</i>

158
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,220
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist! I need this! Now, get out!

159
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,890
<i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>

160
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,980
<i>We'll just let that dry...</i>

161
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,270
<i>When you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep</i>

162
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,150
<i>and you're never really awake.</i>

163
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,530
To begin tonight's communion,
Chloe would like to say a few words.

164
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,950
<i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>

165
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,460
<i>Chloe looked the way
MeryI Streep's skeleton would look</i>

166
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,540
<i>if you made it walk around a party
being extra nice to everybody.</i>

167
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,000
Well, I'm still here.

168
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,880
But I don't know for how long.

169
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,760
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

170
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,550
But I've got some good news.

171
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,640
I no longer have any fear of death.

172
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,270
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

173
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,570
No one will have sex with me.

174
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,820
I'm so close to the end,

175
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,070
and all I want is to get laid for
the last time.

176
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:54,620
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,

177
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,080
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.

178
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,290
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

179
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,550
Thank you, Chloe.

180
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,180
Now, let's ready ourself
for guided meditation.

181
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,470
You're standing at the entrance
of your cave.

182
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,190
You step inside your cave and you walk...

183
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,730
<i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>

184
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,110
<i>Marla.</i>

185
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
<i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth</i>

186
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,860
<i>that would heal if you could stop
tonguing it, but you can't.</i>

187
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,330
...deeper into your cave as you walk.

188
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,120
<i>You feel
a healing energy all around you.</i>

189
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,290
<i>Now find your power animal.</i>

190
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,010
Slide.

191
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,390
OK. Let's partner up.

192
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,520
Pick someone special to you tonight.

193
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,730
Hey.

194
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,990
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

195
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,080
- I'm onto you.
- What?

196
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,160
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

197
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,080
Sorry?

198
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,750
In the Tibetan-philosophy,
Sylvia Plath sense, I know we're all dying.

199
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,340
But you're not dying
the way Chloe back there is dying.

200
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,670
So?

201
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,180
So you're a tourist.

202
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:37,930
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.

203
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,060
I saw you at testicular cancer!

204
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,190
I saw you practicing this.

205
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,480
- Practicing what?
- Telling me off.

206
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,570
Is it going as well as you hoped...
"Rupert"?

207
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,860
- I'll expose you.
- Go ahead. I'll expose you.

208
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,860
Come together. Let yourselves cry.

209
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,790
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

210
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,290
It's cheaper than a movie and coffee's free.

211
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,090
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.

212
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,300
I've been coming for over a year.

213
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,390
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

214
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:20,310
When people think you're dying,
they really listen to you instead of...

215
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,310
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

216
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,850
Yeah. Yeah.

217
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,440
Share yourself, completely.

218
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,490
You don't want to get into this.
It becomes an addiction.

219
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,820
- Really?
- I'm not kidding.

220
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,330
I can't cry if another faker is present,
and I need this.

221
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,000
So you gotta find somewhere else to go.

222
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,170
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.

223
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,420
Wait a second. Hold on.

224
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,930
We'll split up the week, OK?
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

225
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,680
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

226
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,180
Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.

227
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,310
Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.

228
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,770
- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?

229
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,310
No. No.

230
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,360
- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.

231
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,200
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.

232
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,860
I want brain parasites.

233
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,870
I'll take the blood,
but I want brain dementia.

234
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:23,540
- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.

235
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,210
So far, you have four. I only have two.

236
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,790
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.

237
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,420
Now we both have three...

238
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,630
Hey! You left half your clothes.

239
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,740
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes, I'm selling some clothes.

240
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,910
So, we each have three. That's six.

241
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,410
What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.

242
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,580
<i>The girl had done her homework.</i>

243
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,540
- No. No. I want bowel cancer.
- That's your favorite too?

244
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,670
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.

245
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,050
Take the first and third Sunday
of the month.

246
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,390
Deal.

247
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,770
- Looks like this is goodbye.
- Let's not make a big thing out of it.

248
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,480
How's this for not making a big thing?

249
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,110
Hey, Marla! Marla!

250
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,530
- Maybe we should exchange numbers.
- Should we?

251
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,990
We might wanna switch nights.

252
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,250
OK.

253
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,340
<i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>

254
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,550
<i>Marla's philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment.</i>

255
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,180
<i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i>

256
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,640
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you?

257
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,980
Cornelius? Rupert? Travis?

258
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,980
Any of the stupid names
you give each night?

259
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,860
<i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>

260
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,900
<i>SFO. LAX.</i>

261
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,410
<i>You wake up at O'Hare.
Dallas Fort Worth. BWI.</i>

262
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,330
<i>Pacific. Mountain. CentraI.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.</i>

263
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,460
Check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours.

264
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,170
<i>This is your life,
and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>

265
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,010
<i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>

266
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,550
<i>If you wake up at a different time,
in a different place,</i>

267
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,760
<i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>

268
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,230
<i>Everywhere I travel, tiny life.</i>

269
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,610
<i>Single-serving sugar, single-serving cream,
single pat of butter.</i>

270
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,070
<i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>

271
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:06,160
<i>Shampoo-conditioner combos. Sample
package mouthwash. Tiny bars of soap.</i>

272
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:12,410
<i>The people I meet on each flight,
they're single-serving friends.</i>

273
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:18,590
<i>Between takeoff and landing, we have
our time together, but that's all we get.</i>

274
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,630
<i>Welcome!</i>

275
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,050
<i>On a long-enough time line,</i>

276
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,300
<i>the survivaI rate for
everyone drops to zero.</i>

277
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,100
<i>I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.</i>

278
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,270
The infant went through the windshield.
Three points.

279
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,440
<i>A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>

280
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,820
<i>The rear differential locks up.</i>

281
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,780
The teenager's braces
are stuck to the ashtray.

282
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,070
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.

283
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,030
<i>The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.</i>

284
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,490
<i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>

285
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,250
The father must've been huge.

286
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,040
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?

287
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,830
Very modern art.

288
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:01,880
<i>Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.</i>

289
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,590
<i>Multiply it by the probable rate
of failure, B.</i>

290
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,430
<i>Multiply the result by
the average out-of-court settlement, C.</i>

291
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:10,850
<i>A x B x C...</i>

292
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,310
equals X.

293
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,980
If X is less than the cost of a recall,
we don't do one.

294
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,110
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?

295
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,070
You wouldn't believe.

296
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,200
Which car company do you work for?

297
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,530
A major one.

298
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,660
<i>Every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing,</i>

299
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:39,250
<i>I prayed for a crash
or a mid-air collision.</i>

300
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,630
<i>Anything.</i>

301
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:54,470
<i>Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.</i>

302
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:59,730
"If you are seated
in an emergency exit row

303
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,940
"and feel unable or unwilling to perform
the duties listed on the safety card,

304
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,030
"please ask a flight attendant
to reseat you. "

305
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,540
- It's a lot of responsibility.
- Wanna switch seats?

306
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,080
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man for that particular job.

307
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:22,250
An exit-door procedure
at 30,000 feet. Mm-hm.

308
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,800
The illusion of safety.

309
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,920
Yeah. I guess so.

310
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,630
You know why
they put oxzgen masks on planes?

311
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,600
- So you can breathe.
- Oxzgen gets you high.

312
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,270
In a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.

313
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,270
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.
You accept your fate.

314
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,730
It's all right here.

315
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,030
Emergency water landing, 600mph.

316
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,200
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

317
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,450
That's, um...

318
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:58,870
That's an interesting theory.

319
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,630
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

320
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,130
What do you do for a living?

321
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,170
Why? So you can pretend
you're interested?

322
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,430
OK.

323
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,720
You have a kind of
sick desperation in your laugh.

324
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,310
We have the exact same briefcase.

325
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,560
Soap.

326
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:26,860
- Sorry?
- I make and I sell soap.

327
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,860
The yardstick of civilization.

328
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,280
<i>And this is how I met...</i>

329
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,950
"Tyler Durden. "

330
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,240
Did you know if you mix gasoline

331
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:39,750
and frozen orange juice,
you can make napalm?

332
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,500
- No, I did not. Is that true?
- That's right.

333
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,170
One can make all kinds of explosives
using simple household items.

334
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,800
- Really?
- If one were so inclined.

335
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,890
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I've ever met.

336
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,020
- Everything on a plane is single-serving...
- Oh, I get it. Very clever.

337
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,730
Thank you.

338
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,610
How's that working out for you?

339
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,440
- What?
- Being clever.

340
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:17,200
- Great.
- Keep it up, then. Keep it right up.

341
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,240
Now, a question of etiquette.

342
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,410
As I pass,
do I give you the ass or the crotch?

343
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,170
<i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>

344
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,550
<i>Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.</i>

345
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,400
Was it ticking?

346
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,770
Throwers don't worry.
Modern bombs don't tick.

347
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,490
- Sorry. Throwers?
- Baggage handlers.

348
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,820
But when a suitcase vibrates,
the throwers have to call the police.

349
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,580
My suitcase was vibrating?

350
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,960
Nine times out of ten it's an electric razor,
but... every once in a while...

351
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,630
it's a dildo.

352
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,880
It's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.

353
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:21,850
We have to use the indefinite article-
"a dildo", never "your dildo".

354
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,640
I don't own...

355
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:33,650
<i>I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts. My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.</i>

356
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,900
<i>Never mind.</i>

357
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,620
Hey! That's my car!

358
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,540
<i>Home was a condo on
the 15th floor of a filing cabinet</i>

359
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:53,920
<i>for widows and young professionals.</i>

360
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,010
<i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>

361
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,390
<i>A foot of concrete's important
when your next-door neighbor</i>

362
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:02,300
<i>has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>

363
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:06,680
<i>Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects</i>

364
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,560
<i>blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night.</i>

365
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,410
<i>I suppose these things happen.</i>

366
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,340
There's... nothing up there.

367
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,670
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

368
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:48,980
Do you have somebody you can call?

369
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:54,150
<i>How embarrassing.
A housefuI of condiments and no food.</i>

370
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
<i>The police later told me the pilot light</i>

371
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:10,160
<i>might have gone out,
letting out a little bit of gas.</i>

372
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,790
<i>That gas could have
slowly filled the condo -</i>

373
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,300
<i>1700 square feet with high ceilings -</i>

374
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,300
<i>for days and days.</i>

375
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,390
<i>Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.</i>

376
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,440
<i>Yeah?</i>

377
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,780
<i>I can hear you breathing, you...</i>

378
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:50,950
<i>If you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>

379
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,330
<i>- Hello?
- Who's this?</i>

380
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,090
<i>- Tyler?
- Who is this?</i>

381
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:41,420
Um...

382
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,050
We met... We met on the airplane.

383
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,140
We had the same suitcase?

384
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,430
<i>- Uh... the clever guy.
- Oh, yeah. Right.</i>

385
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,600
I called a second ago.
There was no answer. I'm at a payphone.

386
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:59,610
<i>Yeah, I *69'd you.
I never pick up my phone.</i>

387
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,150
<i>- So what's up?
- Uh...</i>

388
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,490
Well...

389
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,990
You're not gonna believe this.

390
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,700
It could be worse.

391
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:18,290
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.

392
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,630
There's always that.

393
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,840
It's just, when you buy furniture,
you tell yourself:

394
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,340
That's the last sofa I'll need.

395
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:30,220
Whatever else happens,
I've got that sofa problem handled.

396
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,520
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.

397
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,270
A wardrobe that was
getting very respectable.

398
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:39,020
I was close to being complete.

399
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,190
- Shit, man. And now it's all gone.
- All gone.

400
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,530
All gone.

401
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:48,740
Do you know what a duvet is?

402
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,330
- A comforter.
- It's a blanket. Just a blanket.

403
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,290
Why do guys like us know what a duvet is?

404
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:59,540
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?

405
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,960
No.

406
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:05,760
- What are we, then?
- I dunno. Consumers.

407
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:08,050
Right. We're consumers.

408
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,220
We are by-products of
a lifestyle obsession.

409
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,640
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

410
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,560
What concerns me
are celebrity magazines,

411
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,440
television with 500 channels,

412
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,150
some guy's name on my underwear.

413
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,820
Rogaine. Viagra. Olestra.

414
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,530
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.

415
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:32,620
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down.

416
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,910
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

417
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,460
I say never be complete.

418
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,630
I say stop being perfect.

419
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
I say let's evolve.

420
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,760
Let the chips fall where they may.

421
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,680
But that's me, and I could be wrong.
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

422
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,010
It's just stuff. It's not a tragedy.

423
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,600
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

424
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:02,350
Fuck, you're right.
No, I don't smoke.

425
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,820
My insurance is probably
gonna cover it, so...

426
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,740
- What?
- The things you own end up owning you.

427
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,330
But do what you like, man.

428
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,840
Oh, it's late.

429
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,130
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.

430
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,220
I should find a hotel.

431
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,840
- Oh!
- What?

432
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,010
What?

433
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,640
- A hotel?
- Yeah.

434
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,930
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?

435
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,560
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

436
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:47,610
- What?
- You called me

437
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,610
'cause you need a place to stay.

438
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:53,200
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.

439
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,820
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

440
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,830
Would... Would that be a problem?

441
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:02,210
Is it a problem for you to ask?

442
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,460
- Can I stay at your place?
- Yeah.

443
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,340
Thanks.

444
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,760
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Yeah, sure.

445
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,760
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

446
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,850
- What?
- I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

447
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,900
<i>Let me tell you a little about Tyler Durden.</i>

448
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:32,190
Tyler was a night person.
While the rest of us slept, he worked.

449
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,110
He had one part-time job
as a projectionist.

450
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,700
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.

451
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,160
So someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment

452
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,750
that one reel ends
and the next one begins.

453
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:49,800
If you look, you can see little dots come
into the upper right corner of the screen.

454
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,710
In the industry,
we call them cigarette burns.

455
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,510
That's the cue for a changeover.

456
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,390
He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.

457
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,220
Why would anyone want this shit job?

458
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:05,100
'Cause it affords him
interesting opportunities.

459
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,150
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

460
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,820
So when the snooty cat
and the courageous dog

461
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,150
with the celebrity voices first meet,

462
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,950
you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

463
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,670
Nobody knows
that they saw it but they did.

464
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,750
Nice big cock.

465
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,590
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

466
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,810
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman Hotel.

467
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,650
He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.

468
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,280
Do not watch.
I cannot go when you watch.

469
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,200
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,

470
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,910
he farted on meringues,
sneezed on endives...

471
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,620
As for the cream of mushroom soup...

472
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,130
- Go ahead, tell 'em.
- You get the idea.

473
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,880
- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favor.

474
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,220
- Why?
- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?

475
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:21,550
- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourself if you haven't.

476
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,060
I don't wanna die without any scars.

477
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:28,350
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.

478
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,400
So go crazy! Let it rip.

479
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,730
- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.

480
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,740
Who gives a shit? No one's watching.
What do you care?

481
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,150
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?

482
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,740
That's right.

483
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,330
- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.

484
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,790
This is so fucking stupid.

485
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,930
Motherfucker!
You hit me in the ear!

486
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,180
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Ow! Christ!

487
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,930
Why the ear, man?

488
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,480
- I fucked it up.
- No, that was perfect.

489
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,150
Ugh! Agh!

490
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
No, it's all right.

491
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,410
It really hurts.

492
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,870
Right.

493
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,500
- Hit me again.
- No, you hit me. Come on!

494
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,940
We should do this again sometime.

495
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,790
- Where's your car?
- What car?

496
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,180
<i>I don't know how Tyler found that house,
but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>

497
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,430
<i>It looked like it was
waiting to be torn down.</i>

498
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,890
<i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>

499
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,480
<i>There was no lock on the front door</i>

500
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,650
<i>from when the police,
or whoever, kicked it in.</i>

501
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,360
<i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>

502
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,280
<i>I didn't know if he owned it
or was squatting.</i>

503
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,860
<i>Neither would have surprised me.</i>

504
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,780
Yep. That's you.

505
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,080
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?

506
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,620
Yeah, thanks.

507
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,580
<i>What a shithole.</i>

508
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,460
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

509
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,220
<i>Turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out.</i>

510
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,590
<i>There were no neighbors.
Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>

511
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,600
<i>That fart smell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.</i>

512
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
Hey. What have we here?

513
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,490
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

514
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:47,720
<i>Every time it rained,
we had to kill the power.</i>

515
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,260
<i>By the end of the first month,
I didn't miss TV.</i>

516
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,930
<i>I didn't even mind the warm,
stale refrigerator.</i>

517
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,530
Can I be next?

518
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,370
All right, man.

519
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,910
Lose the tie.

520
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,840
<i>At night, Tyler and I were alone
for half a mile in every direction.</i>

521
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:36,390
<i>Rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures.</i>

522
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,100
<i>Everything wooden swelled and shrank.</i>

523
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,440
<i>Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.</i>

524
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,190
<i>The previous occupant
had been a bit of a shut-in.</i>

525
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,530
- What are you reading?
- Listen to this.

526
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:52,070
It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

527
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,490
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata. "

528
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,330
"Without me, Jack could not regulate

529
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:59,040
"his heart rate,
blood pressure or breathing. "

530
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,250
There's a whole series of these.

531
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:05,670
"I Am JilI's Nipples. "
"I Am Jack's Colon. "

532
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,340
Yeah. "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack. "

533
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,010
Whoop! Agh!

534
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:16,260
<i>After fighting, everything else in life
got the volume turned down.</i>

535
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,680
What?

536
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:23,770
<i>- You could deal with anything.
- Have you finished those reports?</i>

537
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,280
If you could choose,
who would you fight?

538
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,200
I'd fight my boss, probably.

539
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,450
Really?

540
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:38,790
- Yeah. Why? Who would you fight?
- I'd fight my dad.

541
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,870
I don't know my dad.

542
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,630
I mean, I know him, but he left
when I was, like, six years old.

543
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,250
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.

544
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,210
He did this every six years.

545
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,970
- He moves city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises.

546
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:59,720
My dad never went to college,
so it was real important that I go.

547
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,230
That sounds familiar.

548
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:05,150
So I graduate. I call him up long distance
and say, "Dad, now what?"

549
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,400
- He says, "Get a job. "
- Same here.

550
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,150
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.
"Dad, now what?"

551
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,700
He says, "I dunno. Get married. "

552
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,830
You can't get married.

553
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,120
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

554
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:24,460
We're a generation of men
raised by women.

555
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,340
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

556
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,350
<i>Most of the week,
we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>

557
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,230
<i>But every Saturday night,
we were finding something out.</i>

558
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,690
<i>We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.</i>

559
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:54,650
<i>It used to be that when I came home angry
or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>

560
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:57,160
<i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>

561
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,780
<i>I should have been
looking for a new condo,</i>

562
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,450
<i>haggling with my insurance company.</i>

563
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:07,330
<i>I should have been upset about my nice
flaming little shit -but I wasn't.</i>

564
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,550
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.

565
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:14,880
<i>Monday mornings,
all I thought about was next week.</i>

566
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:17,840
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

567
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,430
Absolutely.

568
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,220
Efficiency is priority No. 1, people.

569
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,850
Because waste is a thief.

570
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,230
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?

571
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,030
<i>You can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick.</i>

572
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:41,740
<i>It was right in everyone's face.
Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>

573
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,580
<i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.
Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>

574
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,430
Come on, people, you've gotta go home!

575
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:24,450
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

576
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,730
<i>Every week, Tyler gave the rules
that he and I decided.</i>

577
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:51,310
Gentlemen!

578
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:53,860
Welcome to Fight Club.

579
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,410
The first rule of Fight Club is
you do not talk about Fight Club.

580
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,660
The second rule of Fight Club is...

581
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:06,620
you do not talk about Fight Club!

582
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,080
Third rule of Fight Club:

583
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:12,670
someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,

584
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,420
the fight is over.

585
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,420
Fourth rule: only two guys to a fight.

586
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,930
Fifth rule: one fight at a time, fellas.

587
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,970
Sixth rule: no shirts, no shoes.

588
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:29,390
Seventh rule: fights will go on
as long as they have to.

589
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:37,230
And the eighth and final rule: if this is
your first night at Fight Club,

590
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,440
you have to fight.

591
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,080
<i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>

592
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,460
<i>couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>

593
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:53,630
<i>But Ricky was a god for ten minutes</i>

594
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:57,340
<i>when he trounced
the maitre d' of a locaI food court.</i>

595
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:01,170
<i>Sometimes,
all you could hear were the flat,</i>

596
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,220
<i>hard, packing sounds over the yelling.</i>

597
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,930
<i>Or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed...</i>

598
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,230
Stop!

599
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,440
<i>You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.</i>

600
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:20,530
<i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>

601
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,820
<i>Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,</i>

602
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:26,280
<i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>

603
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:27,700
<i>Who you were in Fight Club</i>

604
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,660
<i>is not who you were
in the rest of the world.</i>

605
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:35,080
<i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>

606
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:38,420
<i>After a few weeks,
he was carved out of wood.</i>

607
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,010
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

608
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:45,220
- Alive or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

609
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,600
Hemingway. You?

610
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,100
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.

611
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,810
<i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>

612
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,900
<i>Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.</i>

613
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:08,490
<i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>

614
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,620
<i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>

615
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,120
Is that what a man looks like?

616
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,290
Ah, self-improvement is masturbation.

617
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,920
Now, self-destruction...

618
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,420
Excuse me.

619
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,170
<i>Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.</i>

620
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,210
<i>It wasn't about words.</i>

621
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:09,640
<i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues,
like at a PentecostaI Church.</i>

622
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,520
- Is that it?
- Stop!

623
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,940
<i>When the fight was over,
nothing was solved.</i>

624
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,020
<i>But nothing mattered.</i>

625
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:23,190
Cool.

626
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:28,070
<i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>

627
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,570
Hey, man. How about next week?

628
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:33,580
How about next month?

629
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:37,000
Irvine, you're in the middle.
New guy, you too.

630
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:41,460
<i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>

631
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,540
He fell down some stairs.

632
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:46,260
I fell down some stairs.

633
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:52,800
<i>Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>

634
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:54,890
OK. Any historical figure.

635
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:59,640
- I'd fight Gandhi.
- Good answer.

636
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,560
- How about you?
- Lincoln.

637
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,570
- Lincoln?
- Mm-hm.

638
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:08,820
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

639
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,280
Fuck!

640
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:15,450
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

641
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,380
Hello?

642
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,300
<i>Where have you been
the last eight weeks?</i>

643
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,630
Marla?

644
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:36,100
<i>- How did you find me?
- You left a forwarding number.</i>

645
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,980
I haven't seen you at any support groups.

646
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:42,020
<i>We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?</i>

647
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,310
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.

648
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,780
- How do you know?
- I cheated.

649
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,030
I found a new one.

650
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,450
- Really?
- It's for men only.

651
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,240
Like the testicle thing?

652
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,780
Whah!

653
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:03,330
- Look, this is a bad time.
- I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

654
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:06,380
- Some really fucked-up people.
- I'm on my way out.

655
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:09,260
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.

656
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:13,630
I took what was left of a bottle.
It might have been too much.

657
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,720
<i>Picture Marla Singer throwing herself
around her crummy apartment.</i>

658
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:21,640
This isn't a for-real suicide.
It's probably a cry for help.

659
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:23,810
<i>This could go on for hours.</i>

660
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:28,070
- So you're staying in tonight?
- Do you wanna hear me describe death?

661
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:33,070
<i>Do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>

662
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,330
<i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>

663
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,770
<i>Tyler's door was closed.</i>

664
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:09,020
<i>I'd been here for two months
and his door was never closed.</i>

665
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:17,450
You won't believe the dream
I had last night.

666
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:20,580
I can hardly believe
anything from last night.

667
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,510
What are you doing here?

668
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:37,840
- What?
- This is my house.

669
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:39,930
What are you doing here?

670
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,350
Fuck you!

671
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:01,620
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!

672
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:05,580
Limber, though. Silly cooze.

673
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:11,540
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.
Guess who's on the other end.

674
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:14,130
<i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>

675
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,720
<i>Have you ever heard
a death rattle before?</i>

676
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,760
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

677
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:26,730
<i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>

678
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,480
<i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>

679
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:38,780
<i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>

680
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:42,120
<i>How could Tyler, of all people,
think it was a bad thing</i>

681
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,790
<i>that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>

682
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:49,960
<i>...five, four, three...</i>

683
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,670
<i>Hang on.</i>

684
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,800
You got here fast.

685
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:02,850
Did I call you?

686
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,310
Huh?

687
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:16,780
The mattress is all sealed
in slippery plastic.

688
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,070
Don't worry. It's not a threat to you.

689
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:29,120
Oh, fuck! Somebody called the cops.

690
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,180
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.

691
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,100
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

692
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:51,310
She has lost faith in herself.

693
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:54,150
- Miss Singer, let us help you!
- She's a monster!

694
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:58,440
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!

695
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:01,450
- Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!

696
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:11,370
If I fall asleep, I'm done for.

697
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,540
You're gonna have to keep me up...

698
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,710
all night.

699
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:20,050
Un-fucking-believable.

700
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:22,380
<i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>

701
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:25,850
- You know what I mean. You fucked her.
- No, I didn't.

702
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:28,720
- Never?
- No.

703
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,770
- You're not into her, are you?
- No! God, not at all.

704
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,310
<i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>

705
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,980
- Are you sure? You can tell me.
- Believe me, I'm sure.

706
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:41,320
<i>Put a gun to my head</i>

707
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,650
<i>- and spray my brains.
- That's good.</i>

708
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:46,950
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.

709
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,660
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!

710
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:53,910
My God.

711
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:57,590
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.

712
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:00,550
<i>- Euch!
- How could Tyler not go for that?</i>

713
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:03,970
<i>The other night, he was splicing
sex organs into "Cinderella".</i>

714
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,390
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a caseworker.

715
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:09,600
And a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

716
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,060
<i>She invaded my support groups
and now my home.</i>

717
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,890
Hey, hey. Sit down.

718
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,240
- I can't have you talking to her about me.
- Why would I talk to her?

719
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,110
You say anything about me
or what goes on

720
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,490
in this house to her or anybody,
we're done.

721
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,120
- Now promise me.
- OK.

722
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:33,200
- You promise?
- I promise.

723
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:36,120
- Promise.
- I just said, I promise! What...

724
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,540
That's three times you promised.

725
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:43,920
<i>If only I had wasted a couple of minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>

726
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:46,300
<i>none of this would've happened.</i>

727
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,020
Yes! Oh, harder, harder!

728
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:03,690
<i>I could have moved to another room.</i>

729
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:07,660
<i>On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.</i>

730
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,700
<i>But I didn't.</i>

731
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:31,470
Ow!

732
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,100
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.

733
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:41,440
- You wanna finish her off?
- Ooh!

734
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:45,940
- No. No, thank you.
- I found a cigarette.

735
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:49,570
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.

736
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:54,030
<i>I became the calm
little center of the world.</i>

737
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,950
<i>I was the Zen master.</i>

738
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:03,380
<i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>

739
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,260
<i>I emailed them to everyone.</i>

740
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,880
Is that your blood?

741
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,260
Some of it, yeah.

742
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,800
You can't smoke in here.

743
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:19,810
Take the rest of the day off.
Come back Monday with clean clothes.

744
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:21,690
Get yourself together.

745
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:26,690
<i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.
"Yes, these are bruises from fighting. "</i>

746
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,570
<i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that.
I am enlightened. "</i>

747
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:37,580
<i>You give up the condo life and
all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>

748
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,790
<i>go live in a dilapidated house
in a toxic-waste part of town,</i>

749
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:44,080
<i>...and you have to come home to this.</i>

750
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:56,850
Hello?

751
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:00,020
<i>This is Detective Stern
with the Arson Unit.</i>

752
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,520
<i>We have new information about
the incident at your former condo.</i>

753
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:06,400
- Yes?
- I don't know if you're aware,

754
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,530
but someone sprayed Freon
into your front-door lock.

755
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,530
<i>They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>

756
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:17,030
<i>- No, I wasn't aware of that.
- I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>

757
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:21,460
<i>- Does this sound strange to you?
- Yes, sir. Very strange.</i>

758
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,540
- The dynamite...
- Dynamite?

759
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:27,670
...left a residue of
ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.

760
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,590
<i>- Do you know what this means?
- No. What does it mean?</i>

761
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,800
It means it was home-made.

762
00:56:34,590 --> 00:56:37,510
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

763
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,560
Whoever set this dynamite
could have blown out

764
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,560
your pilot light days before the explosion.

765
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,480
<i>- The gas was just a detonator.
- Who'd do such a thing?</i>

766
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,980
<i>- I'll ask the questions.
- Tell him.</i>

767
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,320
"The liberator who destroyed my property
realigned my perceptions. "

768
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,860
<i>Excuse me. Are you there?</i>

769
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,450
Yes. It's hard to know
what to make of this.

770
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,580
Have you recently made enemies

771
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,870
who might have access
to home-made dynamite?

772
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,540
- Enemies?
- "I reject civilization,

773
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,630
especially material possessions. "

774
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:10,340
<i>- Son, this is serious.
- Yes, I know it's serious.</i>

775
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,260
<i>- I mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.</i>

776
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:19,140
Look, nobody takes this more seriously
than me. That condo was my life. OK?

777
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,390
I loved every stick of
furniture in that place.

778
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,690
<i>That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.</i>

779
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:28,270
<i>- It was me!
- I thank the Academy.</i>

780
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:32,610
<i>- Is this not a good time for you?
- Just tell him you fucking did it!</i>

781
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:36,950
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.

782
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:40,910
<i>- Are you still there?
- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?</i>

783
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:45,660
No. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.

784
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,880
<i>- OK?
- OK.</i>

785
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,630
<i>Except for their humping,</i>

786
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:55,550
<i>Tyler and Marla were never
in the same room.</i>

787
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:58,300
<i>My parents pulled
this exact same act for years.</i>

788
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:01,760
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

789
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,560
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

790
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:09,440
You dance all night,
then you throw it away.

791
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,190
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

792
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:15,650
What?

793
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:23,330
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

794
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:25,200
It was worth every penny.

795
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:27,330
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

796
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:33,340
Someone loved it intensely for one day,

797
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,130
then tossed it.

798
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,590
Like a Christmas tree.

799
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,680
So special.

800
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,930
Then... bam!

801
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:48,020
It's on the side of the road.

802
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,690
Tinsel still clinging to it.

803
00:58:52,650 --> 00:58:59,450
Like a sex-crime victim, underwear
inside out, bound with electrical tape.

804
00:58:59,950 --> 00:59:01,950
Well, then, it suits you.

805
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,580
You can borrow it sometime.

806
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:13,290
Get rid of her.

807
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,710
- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.

808
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:21,010
<i>I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.</i>

809
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:27,140
- It's time you left.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

810
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:32,100
- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.

811
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,400
<i>Gotta get off</i>

812
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:37,480
Thanks. Bye.

813
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:42,820
<i>Gotta get off of this merry-go-round</i>

814
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:49,330
<i>Gonna get, need to get, gotta get...</i>

815
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,250
You kids!

816
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:58,420
Why do you still waste time with her?

817
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,970
I'll say this about Marla.
At least she's trying to hit bottom.

818
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:04,470
And I'm not?

819
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:08,520
Sticking feathers up your butt
does not make you a chicken.

820
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:10,730
What are we doing tonight?

821
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,850
Tonight... we make soap.

822
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:17,230
- Really?
- To make soap, first we render fat.

823
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,960
The salt balance has to be just right,

824
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:42,130
so the best fat for soap
comes from humans.

825
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,050
- Wait. What is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.

826
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,690
Aha! Pay dirt!

827
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:00,400
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
The fat of the land!

828
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:08,910
No! Don't pull it.

829
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:16,040
- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.

830
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,800
As the fat renders, the tallows float
to the surface. Like in Boy Scouts.

831
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:31,770
- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.

832
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:37,690
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.

833
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:40,020
Add nitric acid, you got nitroglycerin.

834
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:44,320
If you then add sodium nitrate
and sawdust, you got dynamite.

835
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,070
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

836
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,830
<i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>

837
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:54,500
Ancient peoples found clothes got cleaner
when washed in one part of the river.

838
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:55,910
- You know why?
- No.

839
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,880
Humans were once sacrificed
on the hills above.

840
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,680
Bodies burned, water seeped
through the ashes to create lye.

841
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,220
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.

842
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:13,850
Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a soapy discharge crept into the river.

843
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:16,230
May I see your hand, please?

844
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,610
What is this?

845
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:27,490
- This is a chemical burn.
- Agh! Aaagh!

846
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:30,910
It'll hurt more than you've ever
been burned and leave a scar.

847
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:33,490
<i>If meditation worked for cancer,
it could work for this.</i>

848
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,580
- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!

849
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,540
The first soap was made
from heroes' ashes,

850
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:42,420
like the first monkey shot into space.

851
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,630
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.

852
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,470
<i>I tried not to think
of the words "searing" or "flesh".</i>

853
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:51,470
Stop it! This is your pain,
this is your burning hand.

854
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:54,640
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.

855
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:58,390
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!

856
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,480
- I get the point!
- No!

857
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:01,860
You're feeling premature enlightenment.

858
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,150
It's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're missing it!

859
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,780
I am not...

860
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:14,280
Shut up! Our fathers
were our models for God.

861
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:17,250
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?

862
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:24,040
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.

863
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:27,800
He never wanted you.
In all probability, he hates you.

864
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:31,300
This is not the worst thing
that can happen. We don't need him!

865
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,550
- I agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

866
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,140
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!

867
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:41,190
- I'm getting water!
- You can use water and make it worse or...

868
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:42,810
Look at me!

869
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:46,020
- Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
- Please let me have it, please!

870
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:48,360
First, you have to give up.

871
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:51,240
First, you have to know -not fear -

872
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:54,370
know that someday, you're gonna die.

873
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:56,740
You don't know how this feels!

874
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:05,670
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.

875
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:07,500
OK.

876
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,730
Congratulations.
You're one step closer to hitting bottom.

877
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:33,530
<i>Tyler sold his soap to department stores
at $20 a bar.</i>

878
01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:35,120
<i>God knows what they charged.</i>

879
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,040
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.

880
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:41,000
<i>It was beautifuI.</i>

881
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,790
<i>We were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them.</i>

882
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,380
<i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>

883
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:50,670
<i>I didn't even wear a tie to work anymore.</i>

884
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:54,550
"The first rule of Fight Club
is don't talk about Fight Club"?

885
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,930
<i>I'm half-asleep again.
I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>

886
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:00,520
"The second rule... " Is this yours?

887
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:02,390
Huh?

888
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,560
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.

889
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:08,060
You find this. What would you do?

890
01:05:13,030 --> 01:05:14,950
Well, I gotta tell you,

891
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:18,410
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

892
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:21,950
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.

893
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:26,500
And this button-down,
Oxford-cloth psycho might just snap

894
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:29,460
and then stalk from office to office

895
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:34,970
with an Armalite AR10 carbine
gas- powered semiautomatic weapon,

896
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:38,680
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

897
01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:43,310
This might be someone
you've known for years.

898
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:46,650
Someone very, very close to you.

899
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:50,360
<i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>

900
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:53,530
<i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>

901
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:56,990
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every piece of trash you pick up.

902
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,540
- Compliance and Liability.
- My tit's gonna rot off.

903
01:06:05,870 --> 01:06:08,580
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

904
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,220
What do you mean?

905
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:18,300
I need you to check
for a lump in my breast.

906
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:22,220
- Go to a hospital.
- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.

907
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:25,230
I don't know about this, Marla.

908
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:26,810
Please?

909
01:06:26,890 --> 01:06:30,060
<i>She didn't call Tyler.
I'm neutraI in her book.</i>

910
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:36,610
That's nice. Taking food to...
Mrs. Haniver and Mrs. Raines.

911
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:38,660
Where are they, exactly?

912
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:43,330
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?

913
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:45,250
- No, no.
- I got one for you.

914
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:47,250
Thanks for the thought.

915
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:50,710
What happened to your hand?

916
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:52,590
Oh, nothing.

917
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,670
- Right there?
- Mm.

918
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:59,010
- Feel anything?
- No.

919
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,760
Well, make sure.

920
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:05,270
- OK, I'm pretty sure.
- You feel nothing?

921
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:07,850
No, nothing.

922
01:07:09,600 --> 01:07:12,110
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

923
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:17,030
- No problem.
- I wish I could return the favor.

924
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:19,490
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.

925
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:22,320
- I could check your prostate.
- I think I'm OK.

926
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,120
Well, thanks, anyway.

927
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,380
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

928
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:34,670
See you... around.

929
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:53,770
Cornelius?

930
01:07:53,860 --> 01:07:56,440
Cornelius!

931
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:58,900
It's me! Bob!

932
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:00,490
Hey, Bob.

933
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:07,580
- We all thought you were dead.
- No, no. Still here.

934
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:09,580
How are you, Bob?

935
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:11,370
Better than I've ever been in my whole life.

936
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:14,380
Really? Still Remaining Men Together?

937
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,540
No, no.
I got something so much better now.

938
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:19,380
Really, what is it?

939
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:21,340
Well...

940
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:25,220
The first rule is,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

941
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:27,970
And the second rule is...

942
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:29,720
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

943
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:33,480
- And the third rule is...
- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.

944
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,360
Look at my face, Bob.

945
01:08:38,360 --> 01:08:40,650
That's fucking great.

946
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:43,990
- I've never seen you there.
- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

947
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:48,200
- I go Saturday.
- Congratulations.

948
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:50,790
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

949
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:53,920
Have you heard about the guy
that invented it?

950
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,710
- Yeah, actually...
- I hear all kinds of things.

951
01:08:56,790 --> 01:09:01,010
Supposedly, he was born
in a mental institution

952
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:04,800
and he sleeps only one hour a night.

953
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:07,390
- He's a great man.
- Oh...

954
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:10,220
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

955
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,540
I didn't hurt you, did I?

956
01:09:37,630 --> 01:09:40,170
Actually, you did.

957
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:43,840
Thank you for this.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

958
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,380
<i>Fight Club.</i>

959
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:48,180
<i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>

960
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:50,680
<i>Our gift to the world.</i>

961
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:54,270
I look around, I look around,
I see a lot of new faces.

962
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:57,980
Shut up!

963
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:03,780
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

964
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:15,870
I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

965
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:19,040
I see all this potential.
And I see it squandered.

966
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:24,550
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.

967
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:26,420
Waiting tables.

968
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:28,930
Slaves with white collars.

969
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:34,060
Advertising has us chasing
cars and clothes.

970
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:37,600
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

971
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,650
We're the middle children of history, men.
No purpose or place.

972
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:48,570
We have no Great War.

973
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:50,660
No Great Depression.

974
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:55,290
Our great war is a spiritual war.

975
01:10:55,370 --> 01:10:58,040
Our great depression is our lives.

976
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,840
We've all been raised on TV to believe
that one day we'd be millionaires

977
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,300
and movie gods and rock stars.

978
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:10,300
But we won't.

979
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:13,350
We're slowly learning that fact.

980
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:16,350
And we're very, very pissed off.

981
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:18,430
Yeah!

982
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:23,940
First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...

983
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,280
Who are you?

984
01:11:32,370 --> 01:11:34,950
- Who am I?
- Yeah.

985
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:39,710
There's a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.

986
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:44,130
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?

987
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:45,800
Tyler Durden.

988
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,760
Who told you motherfuckers
you could use my place?

989
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:54,850
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

990
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:59,430
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
He don't own this place. I do.

991
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:05,230
- How much money does he get?
- There is no money.

992
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,070
- Really?
- Free to all.

993
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:10,320
- Ain't that something.
- It is, actually.

994
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:12,450
Look, stupid fuck!

995
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:17,540
- I want everybody out of here right now.
- Hey! You should join our club.

996
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:21,910
- Did you hear what I just said?
- You and your friend.

997
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:26,750
You hear me now?

998
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:30,420
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

999
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:39,930
Still not getting it.

1000
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,730
Agh! OK, OK, I got it.

1001
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:44,270
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.

1002
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:47,900
Back! All of you!

1003
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,860
Everybody back!

1004
01:12:58,490 --> 01:12:59,870
Ah, Lou!

1005
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,710
Come on, man! We really like this place.

1006
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:16,720
- That's right, Lou. Get it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

1007
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,390
Oh, yeah!

1008
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:25,020
That's fucking funny?

1009
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:37,070
Fucking guy's a loony, I'm telling you.

1010
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:39,830
Unbelievable.

1011
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:46,710
- You don't know where I've been, Lou.
- Oh, my God!

1012
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,250
You don't know where I've been!

1013
01:13:53,510 --> 01:13:56,430
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

1014
01:13:56,510 --> 01:14:01,510
- Fucking use the basement! Christ!
- I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

1015
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,350
On my mother's eyes.

1016
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:14,400
Thanks, Lou.

1017
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:18,530
You too, big guy.

1018
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:24,540
We'll see you next week.

1019
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:43,850
This week, each one of you
has a homework assignment.

1020
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:49,440
You're gonna go out. You're gonna
start a fight with a total stranger.

1021
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:54,190
You're gonna start a fight,

1022
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:56,650
and you're gonna lose.

1023
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:01,530
Excellent choice, sir.

1024
01:15:02,910 --> 01:15:05,620
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

1025
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:08,330
<i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>

1026
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,710
What... Son of a bitch!

1027
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,470
<i>Most people -normal people-
do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>

1028
01:15:20,180 --> 01:15:21,680
Excuse me!

1029
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:24,010
You sprayed me with your hose.

1030
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,600
That's not necessary.

1031
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,350
Jay! Go call 911!

1032
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:31,350
Put the hose down.

1033
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,940
Stop it! Stop it!

1034
01:15:37,240 --> 01:15:38,490
Sorry.

1035
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:47,370
You bastard!

1036
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:55,250
We need to talk.

1037
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,130
OK.

1038
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,300
Where to begin?

1039
01:16:02,470 --> 01:16:05,050
With your constant absenteeism?

1040
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:08,020
With your unpresentable appearance?

1041
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:12,850
- You're up for review.
- I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

1042
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:14,900
- What?
- Let's pretend.

1043
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:17,860
You're the Department
of Transportation, OK?

1044
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:23,570
Someone informs you that this company
installs front-seat mounting brackets

1045
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,830
that never pass collision tests,

1046
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:29,080
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,

1047
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:33,000
and fuel injectors
that explode and burn people alive.

1048
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:35,840
What then?

1049
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:38,800
- Are you threatening me?
- No...

1050
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,220
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!
- I have a better solution.

1051
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:45,720
Keep me on the payroll
as an outside consultant

1052
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:47,760
and, in exchange for my salary,

1053
01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:51,730
my job will be never to tell people
these things that I know.

1054
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:57,270
I don't even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.

1055
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:01,610
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,
you crazy little shit?

1056
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:10,120
<i>- Security!
- I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>

1057
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:17,880
Agh!

1058
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,380
What the hell are you doing?

1059
01:17:30,430 --> 01:17:31,810
That hurt.

1060
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,560
Why would you do that?

1061
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:39,400
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

1062
01:17:49,910 --> 01:17:51,740
What are you doing?

1063
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,290
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

1064
01:17:54,410 --> 01:17:57,960
<i>For some reason,
I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>

1065
01:17:58,290 --> 01:17:59,460
No!

1066
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:29,160
<i>Under and behind and inside
everything this man took for granted,</i>

1067
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:32,120
<i>something horrible had been growing.</i>

1068
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:36,120
Look. Just give me the paychecks,
like I asked,

1069
01:18:36,210 --> 01:18:38,500
and you won't ever see me again.

1070
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:41,920
<i>And right then,
at our most excellent moment together...</i>

1071
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:48,050
Thank God! Please don't hit me again.

1072
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,590
<i>Telephone, computer, fax machine,</i>

1073
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:54,890
<i>52 weekly paychecks
and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>

1074
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,480
<i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>

1075
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:01,150
<i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have
Fight Club every night of the week.</i>

1076
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:08,320
<i>Now, nobody was the center of Fight Club
except the two men fighting.</i>

1077
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,370
<i>The leader walked through the crowd,
out in the darkness.</i>

1078
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:17,620
<i>Tyler was now involved in a lawsuit
with the Pressman HoteI</i>

1079
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:19,750
<i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>

1080
01:19:26,130 --> 01:19:28,090
<i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>

1081
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,180
Thank you, sir.

1082
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:43,310
<i>Tyler dreamed up
new homework assignments.</i>

1083
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,190
<i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>

1084
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:28,820
- There's a Fight Club in Delaware City.
- Yeah, I heard.

1085
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:35,320
There's one in Penns Grove too.
Bob even found one up in New Castle.

1086
01:20:35,410 --> 01:20:38,120
- Did you start that one?
- No, I thought you did.

1087
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,290
No.

1088
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:32,050
- Stop.
- What are we doing?

1089
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:33,840
- Turn around.
- What are we doing?

1090
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,550
- Homework assignment.
- What kind?

1091
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,260
Human sacrifice.

1092
01:21:38,680 --> 01:21:43,520
- Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.
- It's a gun. Meet me in the back.

1093
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,310
- Don't fuck around!
- Meet me in the back.

1094
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:49,230
<i>On a long enough time line,</i>

1095
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,980
<i>the survival rate for everyone
drops to zero.</i>

1096
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:56,660
- Stop. What are you doing?
- Hands behind your back.

1097
01:21:57,030 --> 01:21:58,820
Give me your wallet.

1098
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:03,910
Raymond K Hessel.
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.

1099
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,660
Cramped basement apartment?

1100
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:09,290
- How did you know?
- They give shitty apartments letters.

1101
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:13,090
Raymond! You're going to die.

1102
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:14,340
No!

1103
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:16,720
Is that your mom and dad?

1104
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:19,300
They're gonna have to call
the kindly doctor.

1105
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:21,510
Pick up your dental records. Know why?

1106
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,930
- There'll be nothing left of your face.
- Come on!

1107
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:29,560
An expired community college student ID.
What did you study, Raymond?

1108
01:22:30,020 --> 01:22:32,520
- S... Stuff.
- Stuff?

1109
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:34,530
Were the midterms hard?

1110
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:38,530
- I asked you what you studied!
- Biology, mostly.

1111
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:41,740
- Why?
- I don't know.

1112
01:22:41,830 --> 01:22:44,540
What did you wanna be,
Raymond K Hessel?

1113
01:22:46,290 --> 01:22:50,460
The question, Raymond, was:
what did you want to be?

1114
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:53,840
Answer him, Raymond! Jesus!

1115
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:56,470
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
- Animals.

1116
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:59,220
- Yeah. Animal and stuff.
- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

1117
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,390
- So you need more schooling.
- Too much school.

1118
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,520
- Would you rather be dead?
- No, please...

1119
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,940
You'd rather die here, on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?

1120
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:11,860
No. Please, no.

1121
01:23:15,690 --> 01:23:17,700
I'm keeping your license.

1122
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,160
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.

1123
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:25,240
If you're not on your way to being
a veterinarian in six weeks,

1124
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:26,580
you will be dead.

1125
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:30,830
Now run on home.

1126
01:23:35,630 --> 01:23:37,590
Run, Forrest, run!

1127
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:40,510
I feel ill.

1128
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,970
- Imagine how he feels.
- Come on, this isn't funny!

1129
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:49,270
What the fuck was the point of that?

1130
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:53,020
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K HesseI's life.

1131
01:23:53,110 --> 01:23:57,570
His breakfast will taste better
than any meal you and I have ever tasted.

1132
01:23:58,820 --> 01:24:01,110
<i>You had to give it to him.</i>

1133
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:03,450
<i>- Come on.
- He had a plan.</i>

1134
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:06,830
<i>And it started to make sense
in a Tyler sort of way.</i>

1135
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:10,210
<i>No fear. No distractions.</i>

1136
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:14,420
<i>The ability to let that
which does not matter truly slide.</i>

1137
01:24:27,810 --> 01:24:29,730
<i>You are not your job.</i>

1138
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:34,020
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

1139
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:39,150
You're not the car you drive.

1140
01:24:39,570 --> 01:24:42,490
You're not the contents of your wallet.

1141
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:46,030
You're not your fucking khakis.

1142
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:50,370
You are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

1143
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:02,470
I'll be out of your way in a sec.

1144
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:05,140
You don't have to go.

1145
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:08,060
Whatever.

1146
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:13,020
No, I mean... It's OK.

1147
01:25:22,570 --> 01:25:24,820
Are you still going to groups?

1148
01:25:25,780 --> 01:25:26,870
Yeah.

1149
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,950
Chloe's dead.

1150
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,410
Wow. Chloe.

1151
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,460
When did that happen?

1152
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:37,960
Do you care?

1153
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:41,840
I dunno.
I haven't thought about it in a while.

1154
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,380
Yeah, well...

1155
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,720
It was the smart move on her part.

1156
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:50,310
Listen, um...

1157
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:53,930
What are you getting out of all this?

1158
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:55,100
What?

1159
01:25:56,230 --> 01:25:59,230
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...

1160
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:01,320
Is this making you happy?

1161
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,070
Yeah, well, sometimes.

1162
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:08,660
I don't know. I don't understand.

1163
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:14,830
Why does a weaker person need to latch
on to a strong person? What is that?

1164
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:16,920
What do you get out of it?

1165
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:23,630
No... That's not the same thing at all.
It's totally different with us.

1166
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:24,720
"Us"?

1167
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,430
- What do you mean by "us"?
- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?

1168
01:26:29,550 --> 01:26:32,310
- Hear what?
- All that noise. Hold on.

1169
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:35,890
No, wait! Don't change the subject!
I want to talk about this.

1170
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:38,770
- You're not talking about me, are you?
- No.

1171
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:42,110
- What?
- You playing doctor. What was going on?

1172
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:45,570
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

1173
01:26:45,650 --> 01:26:47,650
- I don't think so.
- What do you want?

1174
01:26:47,740 --> 01:26:49,780
- Look at me.
- No. What?

1175
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:54,370
- What is that?
- It's nothing. Don't worry.

1176
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:57,370
- My God. Who did this?
- A person.

1177
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:58,870
Guy or girl?

1178
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,590
- What do you care?
- What do you care if I ask?

1179
01:27:01,670 --> 01:27:03,300
- Leave me alone.
- You're afraid to say.

1180
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:06,090
- I am not. Let me go.
- No! Talk to me.

1181
01:27:06,170 --> 01:27:07,970
Let go of me. Leave me alone!

1182
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:10,050
- This conversation...
- This conversation...

1183
01:27:10,140 --> 01:27:12,640
- ... is over.
- ... is over.

1184
01:27:14,640 --> 01:27:17,060
I just can't win with you, can I?

1185
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:27,110
Hey, this is getting a little old!

1186
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:31,660
What is... What is all this?

1187
01:27:31,740 --> 01:27:33,490
What do you think?

1188
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:36,910
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

1189
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,210
Hey!

1190
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:48,050
Too young. Sorry.

1191
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,470
What's all that?

1192
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:55,140
Tell the applicant
if he's too young, too old or too fat.

1193
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:56,430
Applicant?

1194
01:27:56,520 --> 01:28:00,100
If the applicant waits three days
without food or shelter,

1195
01:28:00,190 --> 01:28:02,650
he may enter and begin training.

1196
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:04,480
Training for what?

1197
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:12,030
You think this is a game?

1198
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,370
You're too young to train here,
end of story.

1199
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:17,040
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.

1200
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:24,380
Bad news, friend.

1201
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:27,090
It's not gonna happen.

1202
01:28:27,170 --> 01:28:29,130
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

1203
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:32,470
It's not the end of the world.
Just... go away.

1204
01:28:33,970 --> 01:28:35,180
Go.

1205
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:39,470
You're trespassing
and I will have to call the police.

1206
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:47,940
Don't you look at me!
You're never getting in this fucking house!

1207
01:28:48,030 --> 01:28:51,360
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!

1208
01:28:51,450 --> 01:28:54,610
<i>Sooner or later,
we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>

1209
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:57,910
I'm gonna go inside
and I'm gonna get a shovel.

1210
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:09,550
Got two black shirts?
Two pair of black pants?

1211
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:12,670
- Yes, sir.
- One pair black boots? Black socks?

1212
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,220
- Sir.
- One black jacket?

1213
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,510
- Sir.
- $300 personal burial money?

1214
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:18,430
Yes, sir.

1215
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,810
All right.

1216
01:29:32,610 --> 01:29:34,570
You're too old, fat man.

1217
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:38,280
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.

1218
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:47,460
Bob! Bob!

1219
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:07,060
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

1220
01:30:07,190 --> 01:30:08,900
Space monkey.

1221
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,690
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

1222
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,240
You are too fucking old, fatty!

1223
01:30:21,370 --> 01:30:26,160
And you... You're too fucking blond!

1224
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:28,710
Get out of here, the both of you!

1225
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:30,750
<i>And so it went.</i>

1226
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:32,590
<i>Listen up, maggots.</i>

1227
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:35,590
<i>You are not special.</i>

1228
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,800
<i>You are not
a beautiful or unique snowflake.</i>

1229
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:42,970
<i>You are the same decaying organic matter
as everything else.</i>

1230
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:45,890
<i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>

1231
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:50,190
<i>We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.</i>

1232
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:53,190
<i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>

1233
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:58,280
<i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>

1234
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:01,990
<i>To what purpose? For what greater good?</i>

1235
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,620
<i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>

1236
01:31:12,210 --> 01:31:17,670
When he was like,
"You are not your job," I was like, "Yeah!"

1237
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,720
- Hey, what's all this?
- Hey!

1238
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:27,430
OK!

1239
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,600
- What's going on?
- We're celebrating.

1240
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:31,940
- What are we celebrating?
- Go on.

1241
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:38,860
- Hey.
- Let me get that for you.

1242
01:31:43,330 --> 01:31:46,580
<i>Same great taste.
Pepsi. Generation Next.</i>

1243
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:49,410
Shh!

1244
01:31:50,170 --> 01:31:54,670
<i>Investigators are on the scene.
The Police Commissioner has arrived.</i>

1245
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,260
<i>Could you tell us
what you think has happened here?</i>

1246
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:02,260
<i>We believe this is one of many
recent acts of vandalism around the city</i>

1247
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:05,600
<i>somehow related to
underground boxing clubs.</i>

1248
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:09,430
<i>We will be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.</i>

1249
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:13,520
<i>That was Commissioner Jacobs
who just arrived on the scene</i>

1250
01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:19,150
<i>- of a four-alarm fire that broke out...
- She's hot.</i>

1251
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,400
<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>

1252
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:23,320
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1253
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:27,040
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

1254
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:36,000
What the fuck did you guys do?

1255
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:38,800
<i>Arson investigators
are on the premises...</i>

1256
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:49,470
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.

1257
01:32:55,650 --> 01:32:59,480
<i>The victory in the war against crime
will not come overnight.</i>

1258
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:04,200
<i>It will take dedication and commitment
and, most of all, cooperation.</i>

1259
01:33:04,450 --> 01:33:07,910
<i>Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city.</i>

1260
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:11,330
<i>- However...
- I gotta take a piss.</i>

1261
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:15,750
<i>These are the first steps in a long journey.</i>

1262
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,130
<i>That is why we have
created Project Hope...</i>

1263
01:33:17,210 --> 01:33:18,550
Bob.

1264
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:21,800
<i>...helping others
with prevention and enforcement.</i>

1265
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,880
<i>Project Hope will be a joint effort</i>

1266
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:27,350
<i>between the police
and community leaders.</i>

1267
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:31,680
<i>It will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime.</i>

1268
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:23,030
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.
- Man! His balls are ice-cold.

1269
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:27,030
Hi. You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

1270
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:29,870
You will publicly state
there is no underground group

1271
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:33,500
or these guys are gonna take your balls.

1272
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:38,250
They'll send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times.

1273
01:34:38,330 --> 01:34:42,050
Look, the people you are after
are the people you depend on.

1274
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:46,130
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.

1275
01:34:46,260 --> 01:34:49,970
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.

1276
01:34:54,430 --> 01:34:56,230
Do not fuck with us.

1277
01:35:05,860 --> 01:35:07,240
Ball check!

1278
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:23,840
Bob, this way.

1279
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,340
Let's go.

1280
01:35:27,550 --> 01:35:30,550
<i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>

1281
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:32,100
Hey!

1282
01:35:47,780 --> 01:35:49,030
Yeah!

1283
01:36:21,560 --> 01:36:26,650
<i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda
that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>

1284
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:32,610
<i>I wanted to open
the dump valves on oil tankers</i>

1285
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:35,950
<i>and smother all those French beaches
I'd never see.</i>

1286
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:42,580
<i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>

1287
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:01,730
Where did you go, psycho boy?

1288
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:06,060
I felt like destroying something beautiful.

1289
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:12,820
- Get him to a fucking hospital.
- Yeah.

1290
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:28,250
Don't worry, Mr. Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.

1291
01:37:29,260 --> 01:37:31,050
After you, Mr. Durden.

1292
01:37:32,510 --> 01:37:33,840
After you.

1293
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:54,650
- Something on your mind, dear?
- No.

1294
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:57,490
Yeah. Why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?

1295
01:37:57,580 --> 01:38:01,540
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.

1296
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:05,210
- Why wasn't I included in the beginning?
- Fight Club was the beginning.

1297
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:08,500
Now it's left the basements
and it's Project Mayhem.

1298
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:11,460
We started Fight Club
together. Remember?

1299
01:38:11,550 --> 01:38:13,300
It's as much mine as it is yours.

1300
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:17,430
- Is this about you and me?
- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?

1301
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:19,640
This does not belong to us.

1302
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:22,640
- We are not special.
- Fuck that. You should have told me.

1303
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,520
Hey, Tyler!

1304
01:38:28,230 --> 01:38:30,320
- Goddamn it, Tyler!
- What do you want?

1305
01:38:30,400 --> 01:38:33,610
A statement of purpose?
Should I email you?

1306
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:36,320
- Look...
- You decide your level of involvement!

1307
01:38:36,410 --> 01:38:38,660
I will! I wanna know certain things first!

1308
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:41,160
- The first rule of Project Mayhem...
- Shut up!

1309
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,660
- I wanna know what you're thinking.
- Fuck what you know!

1310
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:50,590
Forget about what you think you know
about life, friendship,

1311
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:53,170
and especially about you and me.

1312
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:57,050
What is that supposed to mean? What...

1313
01:38:59,510 --> 01:39:01,510
What are you doing?

1314
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:05,180
What'll you wish you'd done
before you die?

1315
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:07,890
- Paint a self-portrait.
- Build a house.

1316
01:39:08,230 --> 01:39:10,770
- And you?
- I don't know. Nothing.

1317
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:13,110
- Get in the right lane.
- You have to know!

1318
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:15,990
If you died now,
how would you feel about your life?

1319
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:20,450
I don't know! Nothing good.
Is that what you want to hear me say?

1320
01:39:20,530 --> 01:39:22,280
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

1321
01:39:22,370 --> 01:39:24,540
Stop fucking around! Tyler!

1322
01:39:27,670 --> 01:39:29,290
Jesus Christ!

1323
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:31,790
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!

1324
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:35,760
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!
I am sick of all your shit!

1325
01:39:37,260 --> 01:39:39,300
OK, man. OK.

1326
01:39:40,180 --> 01:39:42,390
- Quit screwing around. Steer!
- Look at you!

1327
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:45,720
- Steer!
- Look at you! You're fucking pathetic!

1328
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:50,440
- Why? Why? What are you talking about?
- Why do you think I blew up your condo?

1329
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:52,650
What?

1330
01:39:52,730 --> 01:39:56,400
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamn seminar.

1331
01:39:57,240 --> 01:40:00,410
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!

1332
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:05,790
- Let go!
- All right. Fine.

1333
01:40:07,370 --> 01:40:08,500
Fine.

1334
01:41:07,680 --> 01:41:10,100
<i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>

1335
01:41:11,310 --> 01:41:13,390
<i>This must have been
what all those people felt like</i>

1336
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:16,610
<i>before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.</i>

1337
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:18,610
Goddamn!

1338
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:25,410
We've just had a near-life experience!

1339
01:41:30,790 --> 01:41:35,670
<i>In the world I see, you're stalking elk
through the Grand Canyon forests</i>

1340
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:38,460
<i>around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.</i>

1341
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:45,010
You'll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.

1342
01:41:45,390 --> 01:41:49,310
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

1343
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:54,480
<i>And when you look down,
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,</i>

1344
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:56,400
<i>laying strips of venison</i>

1345
01:41:56,480 --> 01:42:00,610
<i>in the empty car-pool lane
of some abandoned superhighway.</i>

1346
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:15,500
Feel better, champ.

1347
01:42:33,890 --> 01:42:35,310
<i>And then...</i>

1348
01:42:35,390 --> 01:42:36,810
Tyler?

1349
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:38,560
<i>...Tyler was gone.</i>

1350
01:42:47,030 --> 01:42:48,490
<i>Was I asleep?</i>

1351
01:42:50,530 --> 01:42:51,910
<i>Had I slept?</i>

1352
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:54,540
You are not
a beautiful, unique snowflake...

1353
01:42:54,620 --> 01:42:57,670
<i>The house had become a living thing,</i>

1354
01:42:57,750 --> 01:43:01,090
<i>wet inside from so many people
sweating and breathing.</i>

1355
01:43:01,170 --> 01:43:02,750
We are all part
of the same compost heap...

1356
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:06,970
<i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>

1357
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:10,010
<i>Planet Tyler.</i>

1358
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:14,810
<i>I had to hug the walls, trapped inside
this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>

1359
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:18,270
You can't be smoking!
You know how much ether is in here?

1360
01:43:18,350 --> 01:43:21,190
<i>Cooking and working
and sleeping in teams.</i>

1361
01:43:24,440 --> 01:43:26,110
Hang on a second.

1362
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:47,380
It's under control, sir.

1363
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:52,180
Where's Tyler?

1364
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:55,060
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...

1365
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:57,310
Right. OK.

1366
01:43:59,650 --> 01:44:01,150
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

1367
01:44:01,730 --> 01:44:05,110
<i>My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.</i>

1368
01:44:05,690 --> 01:44:07,690
<i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>

1369
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:15,830
<i>What comes next in Project Mayhem
only Tyler knows.</i>

1370
01:44:16,660 --> 01:44:19,660
<i>The second rule is
you do not ask questions.</i>

1371
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:25,710
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!

1372
01:44:26,550 --> 01:44:28,550
Who are all these people?

1373
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:35,510
The Paper Street Soap Company.

1374
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:39,560
Can I come in?

1375
01:44:42,850 --> 01:44:44,360
He's not here.

1376
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:46,230
What?

1377
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:50,610
Tyler isn't here.

1378
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:53,860
Tyler went away.

1379
01:44:53,950 --> 01:44:55,410
Tyler's gone.

1380
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,630
Jesus! Get some help!

1381
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:30,190
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!

1382
01:45:30,610 --> 01:45:32,650
What happened? What happened?

1383
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:34,030
We were on assignment.

1384
01:45:34,110 --> 01:45:37,200
We were supposed to kill
two birds with one stone.

1385
01:45:37,370 --> 01:45:39,870
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

1386
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:42,410
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

1387
01:45:43,920 --> 01:45:46,420
...and trash a franchise coffee bar.

1388
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:54,930
We had it all worked out, sir.

1389
01:46:02,810 --> 01:46:06,150
- It went smooth until...
- Police! Freeze!

1390
01:46:06,230 --> 01:46:09,020
- What?
- They shot Bob.

1391
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:13,440
- They shot him in the head.
- Fucking pigs!

1392
01:46:18,370 --> 01:46:20,030
Oh, God!

1393
01:46:20,120 --> 01:46:23,950
- Those motherfuckers!
- You morons.

1394
01:46:24,460 --> 01:46:27,420
You run around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?

1395
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:30,040
What did you think was gonna happen?

1396
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:36,930
OK, quick! We gotta
get rid of the evidence - his body!

1397
01:46:37,010 --> 01:46:39,050
- Bury him.
- What?

1398
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:41,810
Take him to the garden and bury him.

1399
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:46,770
- Come on, people, let's go!
- Get the fuck off! Get away from him!

1400
01:46:46,850 --> 01:46:48,230
What are you talking about?

1401
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:51,150
This isn't fucking evidence.
This is a person.

1402
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:54,360
He's my friend
and you're not burying him in the garden!

1403
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:57,150
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.

1404
01:46:57,240 --> 01:47:00,070
- This is Bob.
- But, sir, in...

1405
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:02,410
In Project Mayhem, we have no names.

1406
01:47:02,490 --> 01:47:03,830
Now, you listen to me.

1407
01:47:03,910 --> 01:47:08,420
This is a man and he has a name,
and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?

1408
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:09,580
Robert Paulsen?

1409
01:47:09,670 --> 01:47:12,000
He's a man,
and he's dead now because of us.

1410
01:47:12,090 --> 01:47:13,920
Do you understand that?

1411
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:16,510
I understand.

1412
01:47:18,760 --> 01:47:23,140
In death, a member of Project Mayhem
has a name.

1413
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:27,060
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1414
01:47:27,850 --> 01:47:29,980
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1415
01:47:30,610 --> 01:47:33,480
His name... is Robert Paulsen.

1416
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:37,030
His name is Robert Paulsen.

1417
01:47:37,200 --> 01:47:40,410
- Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.
- His name is Robert Paulsen.

1418
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:46,500
Shut up! This is all over with!

1419
01:48:21,240 --> 01:48:22,280
Tyler?

1420
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:24,870
No, this is Detective Stern
of the Arson Unit.

1421
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:26,580
<i>I need to see you...</i>

1422
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:35,290
<i>I went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticket stubs, bar-hopping.</i>

1423
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:37,340
<i>I didn't know how,</i>

1424
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:40,510
<i>but I could look at 50 different bars,
and somehow I just knew.</i>

1425
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:45,140
I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.

1426
01:48:45,220 --> 01:48:47,180
I wish I could help you,

1427
01:48:47,390 --> 01:48:48,430
sir.

1428
01:48:54,770 --> 01:48:56,610
<i>Every city I went to,</i>

1429
01:48:57,780 --> 01:49:00,240
<i>as soon as I set foot off the plane,</i>

1430
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:02,570
<i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>

1431
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:04,370
Hey! Hey!

1432
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:06,780
Taxi!

1433
01:49:06,950 --> 01:49:08,410
Look at my face. I'm a member.

1434
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:11,710
Now, I just need to know
if you've seen Tyler.

1435
01:49:11,790 --> 01:49:15,420
I'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you,

1436
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:19,840
nor would I, even if I had said information
at this juncture, be able.

1437
01:49:21,970 --> 01:49:24,470
- You're a moron.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

1438
01:49:26,140 --> 01:49:31,230
<i>Tyler had been busy,
setting up franchises all over the country.</i>

1439
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:37,310
<i>Was I asleep? Had I slept?</i>

1440
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:41,150
<i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>

1441
01:49:42,150 --> 01:49:44,530
- We've just heard the stories.
- What stories?

1442
01:49:44,610 --> 01:49:49,200
- Nobody knows what he looks like.
- He has plastic surgery every three years.

1443
01:49:49,740 --> 01:49:51,870
That's the stupidest thing I ever heard.

1444
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:56,330
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
- Is Mr. Durden building an army?

1445
01:49:57,170 --> 01:50:00,300
<i>I was living in a state of perpetual dÃ©jÃ  vu.</i>

1446
01:50:01,170 --> 01:50:04,340
<i>Everywhere I went,
I felt I'd already been there.</i>

1447
01:50:05,090 --> 01:50:07,800
<i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>

1448
01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:11,140
<i>The smell of dried blood.</i>

1449
01:50:12,180 --> 01:50:15,140
<i>Dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>

1450
01:50:15,230 --> 01:50:18,150
<i>That aroma of old sweat,
like fried chicken.</i>

1451
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:23,150
<i>The feeI of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before.</i>

1452
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:25,990
<i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>

1453
01:50:28,950 --> 01:50:34,200
His name is Robert Paulsen.
His name is Robert Paulsen. His...

1454
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:38,710
Welcome back, sir.

1455
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:41,840
How have you been?

1456
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,510
Do you know me?

1457
01:50:45,050 --> 01:50:48,050
- Is this a test, sir?
- No. This is not a test.

1458
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:52,010
You were in here last Thursday.

1459
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:53,810
Thursday?

1460
01:50:54,350 --> 01:50:58,520
You were standing where you are now,
asking how good security is.

1461
01:50:59,060 --> 01:51:01,110
It's tight as a drum, sir.

1462
01:51:03,230 --> 01:51:05,110
Who do you think I am?

1463
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:09,570
- Are you sure this isn't a test?
- No, this is not a test.

1464
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:12,790
You're Mr. Durden.

1465
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:16,080
You're the one who gave me this.

1466
01:51:17,170 --> 01:51:20,880
<i>Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.</i>

1467
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:34,180
<i>- Yeah?
- Marla, it's me.</i>

1468
01:51:34,270 --> 01:51:36,390
<i>- Have we ever done it?
- Done what?</i>

1469
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,560
- Had sex.
- What kind of stupid question is that?

1470
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:42,820
Stupid because the answer's yes
or because it's no?

1471
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:44,900
<i>- Is this a trick?
- No. I need to know...</i>

1472
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:49,490
You wanna know if I think
we were just having sex or making love?

1473
01:51:49,570 --> 01:51:52,200
<i>- We did make love?
- Is that what you're calling it?</i>

1474
01:51:52,450 --> 01:51:55,700
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?

1475
01:51:55,790 --> 01:51:58,540
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.

1476
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:01,210
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.

1477
01:52:01,290 --> 01:52:03,960
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?

1478
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:06,710
<i>We have just lost cabin pressure.</i>

1479
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,670
- What did you say?
- What is wrong with you?

1480
01:52:08,760 --> 01:52:11,220
- Say my name!
- Tyler Durden.

1481
01:52:11,300 --> 01:52:13,890
Tyler Durden, you fucking freak!
What's going on?

1482
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:16,010
- I'm coming over!
- I'm not there!

1483
01:52:18,100 --> 01:52:20,140
You broke your promise.

1484
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:22,520
- Jesus, Tyler.
- You talked to her about me.

1485
01:52:22,610 --> 01:52:27,780
- What the fuck is going on?
- I ask you for one thing. One simple thing.

1486
01:52:27,860 --> 01:52:30,280
Why do people think that I'm you?

1487
01:52:30,860 --> 01:52:32,200
Answer me!

1488
01:52:36,330 --> 01:52:37,410
Sit.

1489
01:52:40,710 --> 01:52:43,710
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?

1490
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,750
I think you know.

1491
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:47,920
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1492
01:52:48,010 --> 01:52:51,050
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?

1493
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:54,140
I... I don't know.

1494
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,520
- You got it.
- No.

1495
01:53:00,770 --> 01:53:03,520
- Do not fuck with us!
- Say it.

1496
01:53:05,060 --> 01:53:06,400
Because...

1497
01:53:08,190 --> 01:53:09,400
Say it!

1498
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:13,700
Because we're the same person.

1499
01:53:13,950 --> 01:53:15,030
That's right.

1500
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:17,700
<i>We are the all-singing, all-dancing...</i>

1501
01:53:17,790 --> 01:53:21,500
- I don't understand this.
- You wanted a way to change your life.

1502
01:53:21,580 --> 01:53:23,790
You could not do this on your own.

1503
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:27,130
All the ways you wish you could be -
that's me.

1504
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:30,590
I look like you wanna look,
fuck like you wanna fuck,

1505
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:35,840
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.

1506
01:53:36,140 --> 01:53:37,180
Oh, no.

1507
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:40,430
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
- What?

1508
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:44,770
- This isn't possible. This is crazy.
- People do it every day.

1509
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:48,820
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

1510
01:53:48,900 --> 01:53:52,950
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.

1511
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:58,910
You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.

1512
01:53:58,990 --> 01:54:00,540
We should do this again sometime.

1513
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:03,160
Other times,
you imagine you're watching me.

1514
01:54:03,250 --> 01:54:06,120
If this is your first time, you have to fight.

1515
01:54:06,210 --> 01:54:09,880
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become...

1516
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:13,010
Tyler Durden.

1517
01:54:13,090 --> 01:54:16,640
You are not your job
or how much money you have!

1518
01:54:17,050 --> 01:54:18,760
- No. You have a house.
- Rented in your name.

1519
01:54:18,850 --> 01:54:22,430
- You have jobs, a life.
- You work nights because you can't sleep.

1520
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:26,440
- Or you stay up and make soap.
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.

1521
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:29,060
Technically, you are.
But it's all the same to her.

1522
01:54:31,730 --> 01:54:33,280
Oh, my God.

1523
01:54:34,110 --> 01:54:36,200
Now you see our dilemma.

1524
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:38,660
She knows too much.

1525
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:42,790
I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.

1526
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:47,170
What... What are you saying?

1527
01:54:47,290 --> 01:54:51,300
This is bullshit. This is bullshit!
I'm not listening to this.

1528
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:54,380
- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.

1529
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:57,630
And we simply
do not have time for this crap.

1530
01:54:59,350 --> 01:55:01,260
<i>It's called a changeover.</i>

1531
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:05,390
<i>The movie goes on,
and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>

1532
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:22,780
- Sir! Are you checking out?
- Yeah. Bill me.

1533
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:26,330
I need you to initial
this list of phone calls, please.

1534
01:55:29,830 --> 01:55:33,550
- When were these made?
- Between 2:00 and 3:30 this morning.

1535
01:55:39,010 --> 01:55:41,350
<i>Have I been going to bed earlier
every night?</i>

1536
01:55:41,430 --> 01:55:43,600
<i>Have I been sleeping later?</i>

1537
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:48,100
<i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>

1538
01:55:51,860 --> 01:55:53,440
Is anybody here?

1539
01:55:55,860 --> 01:55:58,360
<i>DÃ©jÃ  vu, all over again.</i>

1540
01:55:59,530 --> 01:56:02,570
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

1541
01:56:05,330 --> 01:56:06,790
Oh, my God.

1542
01:56:10,540 --> 01:56:12,540
<i>- 1888.
- Who am I calling?</i>

1543
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:15,210
<i>Franklin. This is maintenance.</i>

1544
01:56:16,760 --> 01:56:19,340
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

1545
01:56:19,430 --> 01:56:21,050
Franklin Street?

1546
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:24,180
<i>Yes. Can I help you?</i>

1547
01:56:26,770 --> 01:56:29,350
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

1548
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:32,060
I need to talk to your supervisor
right away.

1549
01:56:32,150 --> 01:56:34,110
<i>- Speaking.
- OK, listen to me.</i>

1550
01:56:34,190 --> 01:56:37,280
Something terrible
is about to happen to your building.

1551
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:39,320
<i>It's under control, sir.</i>

1552
01:56:40,030 --> 01:56:43,490
<i>- Excuse me?
- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.</i>

1553
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:48,580
<i>2160.</i>

1554
01:56:57,010 --> 01:56:59,590
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!

1555
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:04,050
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!

1556
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:06,680
Your bald freaks hit me
with a fucking broom!

1557
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:08,470
They almost broke my arm!

1558
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:10,100
They were burning
their fingertips with lye.

1559
01:57:12,190 --> 01:57:14,980
It'll take a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but hear me out.

1560
01:57:15,060 --> 01:57:18,780
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
- A little more faith than that.

1561
01:57:23,160 --> 01:57:24,990
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

1562
01:57:25,070 --> 01:57:27,830
You have every right to be...

1563
01:57:27,910 --> 01:57:29,490
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

1564
01:57:29,580 --> 01:57:32,080
Sir, anything you order
is free of charge, sir.

1565
01:57:33,290 --> 01:57:35,960
- Why is it free of charge?
- Don't ask.

1566
01:57:36,170 --> 01:57:37,420
Whatever.

1567
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:38,960
I'll have the clam chowder,

1568
01:57:39,050 --> 01:57:42,380
fried chicken with a baked potato
and chocolate chiffon pie.

1569
01:57:42,470 --> 01:57:44,550
Clean food, please.

1570
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:47,220
In that case, sir,
I advise against the clam chowder.

1571
01:57:47,310 --> 01:57:49,430
No clam chowder. Thank you.

1572
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:54,060
You got about 30 seconds.

1573
01:57:55,690 --> 01:57:58,900
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?

1574
01:57:59,230 --> 01:58:01,740
I know it seems there's two sides to me...

1575
01:58:01,820 --> 01:58:03,900
Two sides?
You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.

1576
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:07,320
I deserved that.
But I realized something important.

1577
01:58:07,410 --> 01:58:08,620
What?

1578
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:11,950
The full extent of our relationship
wasn't clear to me until now,

1579
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:14,080
for reasons I won't go into.

1580
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:16,580
- I know I haven't treated you well.
- Whatever.

1581
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:21,090
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!
Fifteen seconds, don't open your mouth.

1582
01:58:21,630 --> 01:58:23,760
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.

1583
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:27,510
What I've come to realize
is that I really like you, Marla.

1584
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:31,470
- You do?
- I really do.

1585
01:58:32,230 --> 01:58:36,650
I care about you and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.

1586
01:58:36,730 --> 01:58:39,360
Your life is in danger.

1587
01:58:41,190 --> 01:58:44,030
- What?
- You need to leave town for a while.

1588
01:58:44,150 --> 01:58:46,450
Get out of any major city.
Just go camping...

1589
01:58:46,530 --> 01:58:48,240
You're an insane person.

1590
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:52,080
- I've involved you in something terrible.
- No. Shut up!

1591
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:54,250
- You're not safe.
- Shut up!

1592
01:58:56,710 --> 01:59:00,880
- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
- I know you did.

1593
01:59:01,050 --> 01:59:06,220
There are things about you I like.
You're smart, funny, spectacular in bed.

1594
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:09,470
But... you're intolerable.

1595
01:59:10,140 --> 01:59:13,970
You have very serious emotional problems

1596
01:59:14,060 --> 01:59:15,980
for which you should seek
professional help.

1597
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:20,230
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, I'm sorry, everyone's sorry.

1598
01:59:21,610 --> 01:59:23,610
I can't do this anymore.

1599
01:59:24,440 --> 01:59:26,900
I can't. I won't.

1600
01:59:28,780 --> 01:59:30,070
I'm gone.

1601
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:33,240
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!

1602
01:59:36,870 --> 01:59:38,580
- Marla, you don't understand!
- Leave me alone!

1603
01:59:38,670 --> 01:59:40,880
I am trying to protect you!

1604
01:59:41,090 --> 01:59:44,250
- I never want to see you again!
- If that's what it takes...

1605
01:59:44,630 --> 01:59:46,380
Wait right here.

1606
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,760
Hold it right there! Shut up!

1607
01:59:53,390 --> 01:59:56,810
Take this money and get on this bus.
I promise I will never bother you again.

1608
01:59:58,100 --> 01:59:59,390
Shut up!

1609
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:02,440
Please get on the bus.
Please get on the bus.

1610
02:00:03,980 --> 02:00:06,820
- Why are you doing this?
- They think you're a threat.

1611
02:00:06,900 --> 02:00:09,030
I can't explain now. Trust me.

1612
02:00:09,110 --> 02:00:11,030
If I see where you're going,
you won't be safe.

1613
02:00:11,120 --> 02:00:13,740
I'm not paying this back.
I consider it asshole tax.

1614
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:17,620
Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities
for a couple of days, OK?

1615
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:18,960
Tyler...

1616
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:22,710
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

1617
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:40,190
Hello. I need you to arrest me.

1618
02:00:40,850 --> 02:00:43,100
I am the leader of a terrorist organization

1619
02:00:43,190 --> 02:00:47,690
responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism and assault all over this city.

1620
02:00:48,360 --> 02:00:51,820
In the metropolitan area,
we had probably 200 members.

1621
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:56,240
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.

1622
02:00:56,330 --> 02:00:59,540
This is a tightly regimented organization

1623
02:00:59,620 --> 02:01:04,170
with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership.

1624
02:01:05,170 --> 02:01:09,010
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.

1625
02:01:09,630 --> 02:01:11,260
That's our headquarters.

1626
02:01:11,340 --> 02:01:16,180
In the back, buried in the garden,
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.

1627
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:19,850
In the basement, you'll find some bathtubs

1628
02:01:19,930 --> 02:01:24,520
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

1629
02:01:25,770 --> 02:01:28,610
I believe the plan is
to blow up the headquarters

1630
02:01:28,690 --> 02:01:30,530
of these credit-card companies

1631
02:01:30,610 --> 02:01:32,400
and the TRW building.

1632
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:37,530
Why these buildings?
Why credit-card companies?

1633
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:41,330
If you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.

1634
02:01:42,210 --> 02:01:44,290
You'll create total chaos.

1635
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:49,840
Keep him talking.
I need to make a phone call.

1636
02:01:59,970 --> 02:02:02,390
I really admire what you're doing.

1637
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:06,270
- What?
- You're a brave man to order this.

1638
02:02:07,230 --> 02:02:09,020
You're a genius, sir.

1639
02:02:09,110 --> 02:02:13,110
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,

1640
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:15,780
we gotta get his balls.

1641
02:02:16,910 --> 02:02:20,370
- Don't fight.
- It's a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.

1642
02:02:20,450 --> 02:02:23,620
- It'll set quite an example.
- You're making a big mistake!

1643
02:02:23,710 --> 02:02:25,920
- You said you'd say that.
- I'm not Tyler Durden!

1644
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,290
You told us you'd say that too.

1645
02:02:28,840 --> 02:02:30,840
All right. I am Tyler Durden.

1646
02:02:30,920 --> 02:02:35,550
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.
We're aborting this mission now.

1647
02:02:35,630 --> 02:02:38,350
You said you would definitely say that.

1648
02:02:40,140 --> 02:02:41,680
Let me go!

1649
02:02:42,930 --> 02:02:46,600
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!

1650
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:49,860
Is somebody timing this?

1651
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:51,730
Keep your mouth shut.

1652
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:54,110
Shit!

1653
02:02:57,780 --> 02:03:00,780
- Some of this information checks out.
- Uh- huh?

1654
02:03:01,160 --> 02:03:04,040
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
- Be right there.

1655
02:03:05,370 --> 02:03:06,460
Hey, wait!

1656
02:03:06,620 --> 02:03:07,870
- You got him?
- I got him.

1657
02:03:07,960 --> 02:03:09,580
Sir, we have to do this.

1658
02:03:09,670 --> 02:03:12,420
- Stop fighting!
- Where's the rubber band?

1659
02:03:12,510 --> 02:03:15,510
Get away from me!
Drop that fucking knife!

1660
02:03:18,550 --> 02:03:22,100
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!

1661
02:03:24,230 --> 02:03:26,100
Get down on the floor!

1662
02:03:30,650 --> 02:03:34,730
First person that comes out this door
gets a lead salad! Understand?

1663
02:03:59,590 --> 02:04:01,510
Get away! Stay away!

1664
02:04:14,650 --> 02:04:15,820
<i>I ran.</i>

1665
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:21,200
<i>I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>

1666
02:04:23,950 --> 02:04:25,990
<i>Then I ran some more.</i>

1667
02:05:07,540 --> 02:05:10,540
What the fuck are you doing,
running around in your underpants?

1668
02:05:10,620 --> 02:05:12,420
You look crazy!

1669
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:15,500
No. I'm onto you.
I know what's going on here.

1670
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:20,380
Come on, then. I got us a great place
to watch from. It'll be like Pay-per-view.

1671
02:06:09,060 --> 02:06:10,350
Oh, Christ.

1672
02:06:10,430 --> 02:06:12,270
Now what are you doing?

1673
02:06:12,350 --> 02:06:14,440
- I'm stopping this.
- Why?

1674
02:06:14,980 --> 02:06:18,770
- The greatest thing you've ever done.
- I can't let this happen.

1675
02:06:18,860 --> 02:06:20,980
There are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.

1676
02:06:21,570 --> 02:06:23,700
Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?

1677
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:29,030
The buildings are empty. We're not
killing anyone. We're setting them free!

1678
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:31,910
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.

1679
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:34,620
You wanna make an omelet,
you gotta break eggs.

1680
02:06:34,710 --> 02:06:38,000
No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.

1681
02:06:45,380 --> 02:06:49,300
Wouldn't do that.
Not unless I knew which wires were what.

1682
02:06:49,390 --> 02:06:51,350
If you know, then I know.

1683
02:06:56,690 --> 02:07:01,520
Or... maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.

1684
02:07:09,910 --> 02:07:11,240
You think?

1685
02:07:12,580 --> 02:07:15,120
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

1686
02:07:15,210 --> 02:07:17,670
Pull any one but the green one.

1687
02:07:22,760 --> 02:07:25,210
I asked you not to do that!

1688
02:07:27,550 --> 02:07:28,720
Fuck!

1689
02:07:30,010 --> 02:07:32,220
Tyler, get away from the van.

1690
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:37,230
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!

1691
02:07:38,150 --> 02:07:39,520
Goddamn it!

1692
02:07:40,900 --> 02:07:43,070
Whoa! Whoa!

1693
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:47,450
OK.

1694
02:07:47,530 --> 02:07:50,660
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend

1695
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:53,410
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

1696
02:07:55,750 --> 02:07:57,830
Cool it, Tyler!

1697
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:13,510
Aw, come on! Don't go!

1698
02:08:52,640 --> 02:08:53,720
What?

1699
02:09:39,350 --> 02:09:42,890
Three minutes. This is it.

1700
02:09:43,230 --> 02:09:45,350
The beginning.

1701
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:46,900
Ground zero.

1702
02:09:46,980 --> 02:09:51,610
<i>- I think this is about where we came in.
- Want to say a few words for the occasion?</i>

1703
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:55,410
I'm sorry?

1704
02:09:55,490 --> 02:09:57,870
I still can't think of anything.

1705
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:01,120
Ah. Flashback humor.

1706
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:09,170
It's getting exciting now.

1707
02:10:10,550 --> 02:10:14,050
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

1708
02:10:15,970 --> 02:10:20,060
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.

1709
02:10:20,220 --> 02:10:23,180
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

1710
02:10:37,990 --> 02:10:40,700
- Why is she here?
- Tying up loose ends.

1711
02:10:41,450 --> 02:10:44,250
Put me down, you bald-headed fuck!

1712
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:49,340
- I beg you, please don't do this.
- I'm not doing this. We are doing this.

1713
02:10:49,420 --> 02:10:52,420
- This is what we want.
- No. I don't want this.

1714
02:10:52,590 --> 02:10:57,340
Right. Except "you" is meaningless now.
We have to forget about you.

1715
02:10:58,260 --> 02:11:01,180
- You're a voice in my head.
- You're a voice in mine!

1716
02:11:01,270 --> 02:11:04,850
- Why can't I get rid of you?
- You need me.

1717
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:07,270
No. I don't. I really don't anymore.

1718
02:11:07,350 --> 02:11:11,440
You created me. I didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.

1719
02:11:11,650 --> 02:11:14,030
- Take some responsibility.
- I do.

1720
02:11:14,110 --> 02:11:17,610
I am responsible for all of it,
and I accept that.

1721
02:11:17,700 --> 02:11:21,280
So, please, I'm begging you,
please call this off.

1722
02:11:23,790 --> 02:11:25,750
Have I ever let us down?

1723
02:11:27,420 --> 02:11:30,130
How far have you come because of me?

1724
02:11:35,590 --> 02:11:37,680
I will bring us through this.

1725
02:11:37,760 --> 02:11:41,600
As always, I will carry you
kicking and screaming,

1726
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:44,180
and in the end you will thank me.

1727
02:11:44,430 --> 02:11:46,930
Tyler. Tyler.

1728
02:11:47,060 --> 02:11:50,940
I'm grateful to you
for everything that you've done for me.

1729
02:11:51,020 --> 02:11:53,440
But this is too much. I don't want this.

1730
02:11:53,530 --> 02:11:58,320
What do you want? Your shit job back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

1731
02:11:58,410 --> 02:12:00,450
Fuck you! I won't do it.

1732
02:12:01,450 --> 02:12:05,290
- This can't be happening.
- It's already done, so shut up!

1733
02:12:05,870 --> 02:12:09,370
- 60 seconds till CRl.
- No.

1734
02:12:11,080 --> 02:12:14,090
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.

1735
02:12:14,420 --> 02:12:18,260
You're not real. That gun...
That gun isn't even in your hand.

1736
02:12:19,430 --> 02:12:21,220
The gun's in my hand.

1737
02:12:27,350 --> 02:12:30,140
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.

1738
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:41,160
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?

1739
02:12:41,820 --> 02:12:43,740
Not my head, Tyler.

1740
02:12:44,030 --> 02:12:45,450
Our head.

1741
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:49,000
Interesting.

1742
02:12:52,460 --> 02:12:55,380
Where are you going with this, IKEA boy?

1743
02:13:01,430 --> 02:13:04,180
Hey. It's you and me.

1744
02:13:08,140 --> 02:13:09,480
Friends?

1745
02:13:10,890 --> 02:13:12,230
Tyler,

1746
02:13:15,610 --> 02:13:18,190
I want you to really listen to me.

1747
02:13:18,860 --> 02:13:19,900
OK.

1748
02:13:21,910 --> 02:13:23,740
My eyes are open.

1749
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:43,010
What's that smell?

1750
02:14:03,740 --> 02:14:07,070
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, no. What's going on?

1751
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:09,080
Mr. Durden!

1752
02:14:09,450 --> 02:14:10,950
Oh, my God!

1753
02:14:11,960 --> 02:14:13,000
Sir!

1754
02:14:16,460 --> 02:14:19,630
Are you... Are you all right, sir?

1755
02:14:20,050 --> 02:14:23,760
- Oh, yeah, I'm OK.
- You look terrible, sir. What happened?

1756
02:14:24,090 --> 02:14:27,760
- Oh, nothing, it's no problem.
- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.

1757
02:14:27,850 --> 02:14:31,470
- You look awful. You need assistance.
- I'm fine.

1758
02:14:31,980 --> 02:14:34,440
Look, I'm fine. Everything's fine.

1759
02:14:36,520 --> 02:14:39,400
Ow! Stop it!

1760
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:41,940
- Let her go.
- Christ Almighty!

1761
02:14:42,820 --> 02:14:44,030
You!

1762
02:14:44,820 --> 02:14:46,160
Hi, Marla.

1763
02:14:47,660 --> 02:14:51,620
- Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.
- Are you sure?

1764
02:14:51,830 --> 02:14:53,500
Yes, I'm sure.

1765
02:14:55,330 --> 02:14:59,500
You fucker! What sick fucking game
are you playing at, putting me on a...

1766
02:14:59,590 --> 02:15:01,960
Oh, my God, your face!

1767
02:15:02,050 --> 02:15:03,550
Yeah, I know.

1768
02:15:09,010 --> 02:15:11,220
- What happened?
- Don't ask.

1769
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:13,270
- You're shot.
- Yes, I'm shot.

1770
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:15,180
Oh, my God.

1771
02:15:15,310 --> 02:15:18,650
- I can't believe he's standing.
- Tough motherfucker.

1772
02:15:22,820 --> 02:15:24,360
Who did this?

1773
02:15:24,900 --> 02:15:26,530
I did, actually.

1774
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:28,950
Find some gauze.

1775
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:34,870
- You shot yourself?
- Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.

1776
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:36,460
I'm really OK.

1777
02:15:37,960 --> 02:15:40,960
Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.

1778
02:15:54,310 --> 02:15:56,890
You met me at
a very strange time in my life.

1779
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:02,730

02:16:34,470 --> 02:16:39,140
<i>Way out in the water</i>

1787
02:16:39,230 --> 02:16:40,810
